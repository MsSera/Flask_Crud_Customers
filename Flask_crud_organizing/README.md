# Python-Flask-MySQL-CRUD-App
This is Python Flask CRUD Application with backend database MYSQL. It covers all operation that is create, read, edit and delete, also a search functionality that rely on first_name and a login security using gmail and generating access token if it exist this is to ensure privacy safety. I also used libraries and modules for this project from flask import Flask, render_template, request, url_for, flash,jsonify,abort,from werkzeug.utils import redirect,from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, create_access_token, from flask_mysqldb import MySQL,import json,import dicttoxml.
This is for the tests.py import unittest, from flask import Flask,from flask_testing import TestCase,from app import app ,mysql,import json,
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET for testing the correctness of the code.
This project accepts three formats either json,xml or html. Running the app.py will lead you to the output and this also have a test.py that checks for the codes functionality. It also have the config.json this enhances the maintainability, security, and flexibility of the application, making it easier to manage and deploy across different environments.
